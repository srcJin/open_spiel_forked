Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you

Hi Bob,

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George

increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

I hope you are well,

I understand you have been a long time tenant with me, so I hate to
increase rent, but as you know inflation has increased by 6 percent
recently. In order to stay solvent I will need to increase your rent
by 6 percent as well. I hope you understand my thinking.  How do you
feel about this? Would you like to continue renting from me?

Best,

Alice

Dear Gene,

I understand that my payment is due at the end of this month, but I
will find it hard to come up with the money. Would it be possible to
extend the due date by 1 week? This would allow me to come up with the
necessary funds. As a concession, I would be willing to pay early next
month.

How do you feel about this? Do you have any other alternatives that
you would be happy with?

Best,

Joel

Hey Jill,

Thanks for your interest in my baseball card  collection. I see you
like my signed Babe Ruth special edition card. To be honest, I really
like your signed Nolan Ryan jersey. I also like your signed Roger
Clemens ball. Would you be interested in a trade? I have a few other
things you might like to sweeten the deal: Ken Griffey Jr baseball
bat, Mike Trout signed card, ...

What do you think?

Best,

George
